# TMDB Box Office Prediction with Deep Neural Networks

Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction

The aim of this project was to predict movie box-office revenues given movie-related data.  To achieve this, a deep neural network for movie box-office rev-enues prediction is built. As our main goal is to scrutinize the impact of differentmovie-related data on box-office revenues prediction, data processing is firstlyaddressed.
